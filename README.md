# Advent of Code 2024

## Goal

I'm hoping to have time to attempt _some_ days of this year's advent of code. My discretionary time quite is limited at the moment so I'm not likely to manage many of the days, and those that I do attempt will likely be rushed. But some days is better than no days, and rushed days are better than skipped days!

I'm also hoping to attempt a mix of tools and approaches I'm comfortable with, along with those I'm less familiar with. Some days I may intentionally try an unusual approach just to see how it plays out. It's all about having fun and hopefully learning something afterall!
